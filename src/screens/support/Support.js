                  To play Crime Unfolded, the players must identify essential
                  evidence within the case file to achieve three specific
                  objectives. Upon opening the case, the players are provided
                  with the initial objective towards convicting the killer. An
                  online answer key is available to verify if the necessary
                  evidence has been found to fulfill each objective. The answer
                  key also offers hints in case of incorrect answers. Once an
                  objective is successfully completed, players have the option
                  to open a corresponding bonus envelope, which contains
                  additional evidence and reveals the next objective. Upon
                  successfully completing all three objectives for the case, the
                  players can convict the killer and thereby close the case.

                  Have you already checked the three hints provided in the

                  gradually reveals more about the answer, giving you the option
                  to decide how much assistance you require without completely
                  spoiling the solution. If the three hints are still
                  insufficient to find the evidence you need, you can reach out
                  to our live chat agents, if they are available. Alternatively,
                  you can send us a message, and we will aim to respond within

                  The average completion time is approximately 2-3 hours,
                  although this can vary significantly based on factors such as
                  the number of players, their observational skills, and a bit
                  of luck. Most teams consisting of two or more people typically

                  individuals aged 14 and above. We aim to maintain the content
                  at a level that would be comparable to a PG-13 movie. Most
                  older teenagers should have no trouble solving the cases on
                  their own, while some younger ones might require assistance
                  from an older friend or adult. Additionally, we have a
                  selection of kid-friendly cases that exclude any murder,
                  violence, or mature themes. These cases are specifically
                  labeled as "Family Cases."
